# Conditionals and recursion

The main topic of this chapter is the `if` statement, which
executes different code depending on the state of the program. But first
I want to introduce two new operators: floor division and modulus.

## Floor division and modulus

The **floor division** operator, `//`, divides two numbers
and rounds down to an integer. For example, suppose the run time of a
movie is 105 minutes. You might want to know how long that is in hours.
Conventional division returns a floating-point number:

    >>> minutes = 105
    >>> minutes / 60
    1.75

But we don’t normally write hours with decimal points. Floor division
returns the integer number of hours, rounding down:

    >>> minutes = 105
    >>> hours = minutes // 60
    >>> hours
    1

To get the remainder, you could subtract off one hour in minutes:

    >>> remainder = minutes - hours * 60
    >>> remainder
    45

An alternative is to use the **modulus operator**, `%`,
which divides two numbers and returns the remainder.

    >>> remainder = minutes % 60
    >>> remainder
    45

The modulus operator is more useful than it seems. For example, you can
check whether one number is divisible by another—if `x % y`
is zero, then `x` is divisible by `y`.

Also, you can extract the right-most digit or digits from a number. For
example, `x % 10` yields the right-most digit of
`x` (in base 10). Similarly `x % 100` yields
the last two digits.

If you are using Python 2, division works differently. The division
operator, `/`, performs floor division if both operands are integers,
and floating-point division if either operand is a `float`.

## Boolean expressions

A **boolean expression** is an expression that is either
true or false. The following examples use the operator
`==`, which compares two operands and produces
`True` if they are equal and `False`
otherwise:

    >>> 5 == 5
    True
    >>> 5 == 6
    False


<span>`True`</span> and <span>`False`</span> are special values that
belong to the type <span>`bool`</span>; they are not strings:

    >>> type(True)
    <class 'bool'>
    >>> type(False)
    <class 'bool'>

The <span>`==`</span> operator is one of the <span>**relational
operators**</span>; the others are:

      x != y               # x is not equal to y
      x > y                # x is greater than y
      x < y                # x is less than y
      x >= y               # x is greater than or equal to y
      x <= y               # x is less than or equal to y

The <span>`==`</span> operator is one of the <span>**relational
operators**</span>; the others are:


      x != y               # x is not equal to y
      x > y                # x is greater than y
      x < y                # x is less than y
      x >= y               # x is greater than or equal to y
      x <= y               # x is less than or equal to y


Although these operations are probably familiar to you, the Python
symbols are different from the mathematical symbols. A common error is
to use a single equal sign (<span>`=`</span>) instead of a double equal
sign (<span>`==`</span>). Remember that <span>`=`</span> is an
assignment operator and <span>`==`</span> is a relational operator.
There is no such thing as <span>`=<`</span> or <span>`=>`</span>.

      
## Logical operators

There are three <span>**logical operators**</span>: <span>`and`</span>,
<span>`  or `</span>, and <span>`not`</span>. The semantics (meaning) of
these operators is similar to their meaning in English. For example,
<span>`x > 0 and x < 10`</span> is true only if <span>`x`</span> is
greater than 0 <span>*and*</span> less than 10.

<span>`n%2 == 0 or n%3 == 0`</span> is true if <span>*either or
both*</span> of the conditions is true, that is, if the number is
divisible by 2 <span>*or*</span> 3.

Finally, the <span>`not`</span> operator negates a boolean expression,
so <span>`not (x > y)`</span> is true if <span>`x > y`</span> is false,
that is, if <span>`x`</span> is less than or equal to <span>`y`</span>.

Strictly speaking, the operands of the logical operators should be
boolean expressions, but Python is not very strict. Any nonzero number
is interpreted as <span>`True`</span>:

    >>> 42 and True
    True

This flexibility can be useful, but there are some subtleties to it that
might be confusing. You might want to avoid it (unless you know what you
are doing).

## Conditional execution

In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to
check conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly.
<span>**Conditional statements**</span> give us this ability. The
simplest form is the <span>`if`</span> statement:

    if x > 0:
        print('x is positive')

The boolean expression after <span>`if`</span> is called the
<span>**condition**</span>. If it is true, the indented statement runs.
If not, nothing happens.

<span>`if`</span> statements have the same structure as function
definitions: a header followed by an indented body. Statements like this
are called <span>**compound statements**</span>.

There is no limit on the number of statements that can appear in the
body, but there has to be at least one. Occasionally, it is useful to
have a body with no statements (usually as a place keeper for code you
haven’t written yet). In that case, you can use the <span>`pass`</span>
statement, which does nothing.

    if x < 0:
        pass          # TODO: need to handle negative values!

## Alternative execution

A second form of the <span>`if`</span> statement is “alternative
execution”, in which there are two possibilities and the condition
determines which one runs. The syntax looks like this:

    if x % 2 == 0:
        print('x is even')
    else:
        print('x is odd')

If the remainder when <span>`x`</span> is divided by 2 is 0, then we
know that <span>`x`</span> is even, and the program displays an
appropriate message. If the condition is false, the second set of
statements runs. Since the condition must be true or false, exactly one
of the alternatives will run. The alternatives are called <span>
**branches**</span>, because they are branches in the flow of execution.

## Chained conditionals

Sometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than
two branches. One way to express a computation like that is a <span>
**chained conditional**</span>:

    if x < y:
        print('x is less than y')
    elif x > y:
        print('x is greater than y')
    else:
        print('x and y are equal')

<span>`elif`</span> is an abbreviation of “else if”. Again, exactly one
branch will run. There is no limit on the number of <span>` 
elif `</span> statements. If there is an <span>`else`</span> clause, it
has to be at the end, but there doesn’t have to be one.

    if choice == 'a':
        draw_a()
    elif choice == 'b':
        draw_b()
    elif choice == 'c':
        draw_c()

Each condition is checked in order. If the first is false, the next is
checked, and so on. If one of them is true, the corresponding branch
runs and the statement ends. Even if more than one condition is true,
only the first true branch runs.

## Nested conditionals

One conditional can also be nested within another. We could have written
the example in the previous section like this:

    if x == y:
        print('x and y are equal')
    else:
        if x < y:
            print('x is less than y')
        else:
            print('x is greater than y')

The outer conditional contains two branches. The first branch contains a
simple statement. The second branch contains another <span>`if`</span>
statement, which has two branches of its own. Those two branches are
both simple statements, although they could have been conditional
statements as well.

Although the indentation of the statements makes the structure apparent,
<span>**nested conditionals**</span> become difficult to read very
quickly. It is a good idea to avoid them when you can.

Logical operators often provide a way to simplify nested conditional
statements. For example, we can rewrite the following code using a
single conditional:

    if 0 < x:
        if x < 10:
            print('x is a positive single-digit number.')

The <span>`print`</span> statement runs only if we make it past both
conditionals, so we can get the same effect with the <span>`and`</span>
operator:

    if 0 < x and x < 10:
        print('x is a positive single-digit number.')

For this kind of condition, Python provides a more concise option:

    if 0 < x < 10:
        print('x is a positive single-digit number.')

## Recursion

It is legal for one function to call another; it is also legal for a
function to call itself. It may not be obvious why that is a good thing,
but it turns out to be one of the most magical things a program can do.
For example, look at the following function:

    def countdown(n):
        if n <= 0:
            print('Blastoff!')
        else:
            print(n)
            countdown(n-1)

If <span>`n`</span> is 0 or negative, it outputs the word, “Blastoff\!”
Otherwise, it outputs <span>`n`</span> and then calls a function named
<span>`  countdown `</span>—itself—passing <span>`n-1`</span> as an
argument.

What happens if we call this function like this?

    >>> countdown(3)

The execution of <span>`countdown`</span> begins with
<span>`n=3`</span>, and since <span>`n`</span> is greater than 0, it
outputs the value 3, and then calls itself...

> The execution of <span>`countdown`</span> begins with
> <span>`n=2`</span>, and since <span>`n`</span> is greater than 0, it
> outputs the value 2, and then calls itself...
> 
> > The execution of <span>`countdown`</span> begins with
> > <span>`n=1`</span>, and since <span>`n`</span> is greater than 0, it
> > outputs the value 1, and then calls itself...
> > 
> > > The execution of <span>`countdown`</span> begins with
> > > <span>`n=0`</span>, and since <span>`  n `</span> is not greater
> > > than 0, it outputs the word, “Blastoff\!” and then returns.
> > 
> > The <span>`countdown`</span> that got <span>`n=1`</span> returns.
> 
> The <span>`countdown`</span> that got <span>`n=2`</span> returns.

The <span>`countdown`</span> that got <span>`n=3`</span> returns.

And then you’re back in `__main__`. So, the total output looks like
this:

    3
    2
    1
    Blastoff!

A function that calls itself is <span>**recursive**</span>; the process
of executing it is called <span>**recursion**</span>.

As another example, we can write a function that prints a string
<span>`n`</span> times.

    def print_n(s, n):
        if n <= 0:
            return
        print(s)
        print_n(s, n-1)

If <span>`n <= 0`</span> the <span>**return statement**</span> exits the
function. The flow of execution immediately returns to the caller, and
the remaining lines of the function don’t run.

The rest of the function is similar to <span>`countdown`</span>: it
displays <span>`s`</span> and then calls itself to display
<span>`s`</span> \(n-1\) additional times. So the number of lines of
output is <span>`1 + (n - 1)`</span>, which adds up to <span>`n`</span>.

For simple examples like this, it is probably easier to use a <span>` 
for `</span> loop. But we will see examples later that are hard to write
with a <span>`for`</span> loop and easy to write with recursion, so it
is good to start early.

## Stack diagrams for recursive functions

In Section [4.9](#stackdiagram), we used a stack diagram to represent
the state of a program during a function call. The same kind of diagram
can help interpret a recursive function.

Every time a function gets called, Python creates a frame to contain the
function’s local variables and parameters. For a recursive function,
there might be more than one frame on the stack at the same time.

Figure [6.1](#fig.stack2) shows a stack diagram for
<span>`countdown`</span> called with <span>`n = 3`</span>.

As usual, the top of the stack is the frame for `__main__`. It is empty
because we did not create any variables in `__main__` or pass any
arguments to it.

The four <span>`countdown`</span> frames have different values for the
parameter <span>`n`</span>. The bottom of the stack, where
<span>`n=0`</span>, is called the <span>**base case**</span>. It does
not make a recursive call, so there are no more frames.

As an exercise, draw a stack diagram for `print_n` called with `s =
'Hello'` and <span>`n=2`</span>. Then write a function called `do_n`
that takes a function object and a number, <span>`n`</span>, as
arguments, and that calls the given function <span>`n`</span> times.

## Infinite recursion

If a recursion never reaches a base case, it goes on making recursive
calls forever, and the program never terminates. This is known as
<span>**infinite recursion**</span>, and it is generally not a good
idea. Here is a minimal program with an infinite recursion:

    def recurse():
        recurse()

In most programming environments, a program with infinite recursion does
not really run forever. Python reports an error message when the maximum
recursion depth is reached:


    File "<stdin>", line 2, in recurse
    File "<stdin>", line 2, in recurse
    File "<stdin>", line 2, in recurse
    .   
    .
    .
    File "<stdin>", line 2, in recurse
    RuntimeError: Maximum recursion depth exceeded


This traceback is a little bigger than the one we saw in the previous
chapter. When the error occurs, there are 1000 <span>`recurse`</span>
frames on the stack\!

If you encounter an infinite recursion by accident, review your function
to confirm that there is a base case that does not make a recursive
call. And if there is a base case, check whether you are guaranteed to
reach it.

## Keyboard input

The programs we have written so far accept no input from the user. They
just do the same thing every time.

Python provides a built-in function called <span>`input`</span> that
stops the program and waits for the user to type something. When the
user presses <span> Return</span> or <span>Enter</span>, the program
resumes and `input` returns what the user typed as a string. In Python
2, the same function is called `raw_input`.

    >>> text = input()
    What are you waiting for?
    >>> text
    'What are you waiting for?'

Before getting input from the user, it is a good idea to print a prompt
telling the user what to type. `input` can take a prompt as an argument:

    >>> name = input('What...is your name?\n')
    What...is your name?
    Arthur, King of the Britons!
    >>> name
    'Arthur, King of the Britons!'

The sequence `\n` at the end of the prompt represents a <span>
**newline**</span>, which is a special character that causes a line
break. That’s why the user’s input appears below the prompt.

If you expect the user to type an integer, you can try to convert the
return value to <span>`int`</span>:

    >>> prompt = 'What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\n'
    >>> speed = input(prompt)
    What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
    42
    >>> int(speed)
    42


But if the user types something other than a string of digits, you get
an error:

    >>> speed = input(prompt)
    What...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
    What do you mean, an African or a European swallow?
    >>> int(speed)
    ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10

We will see how to handle this kind of error later.

## Debugging

When a syntax or runtime error occurs, the error message contains a lot
of information, but it can be overwhelming. The most useful parts are
usually:

  - What kind of error it was, and

  - Where it occurred.

Syntax errors are usually easy to find, but there are a few gotchas.
Whitespace errors can be tricky because spaces and tabs are invisible
and we are used to ignoring them.

    >>> x = 5
    >>>  y = 6
      File "<stdin>", line 1
        y = 6
        ^
    IndentationError: unexpected indent

In this example, the problem is that the second line is indented by one
space. But the error message points to <span>`y`</span>, which is
misleading. In general, error messages indicate where the problem was
discovered, but the actual error might be earlier in the code, sometimes
on a previous line.

The same is true of runtime errors. Suppose you are trying to compute a
signal-to-noise ratio in decibels. The formula is
\(SNR_{db} = 10 \log_{10} (P_{signal} / P_{noise})\). In Python, you
might write something like this:

    import math
    signal_power = 9
    noise_power = 10
    ratio = signal_power // noise_power
    decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)
    print(decibels)

When you run this program, you get an exception:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "snr.py", line 5, in ?
        decibels = 10 * math.log10(ratio)
    ValueError: math domain error

The error message indicates line 5, but there is nothing wrong with that
line. To find the real error, it might be useful to print the value of
<span>`ratio`</span>, which turns out to be 0. The problem is in line 4,
which uses floor division instead of floating-point division.

You should take the time to read error messages carefully, but don’t
assume that everything they say is correct.

## Exercises

The <span>`time`</span> module provides a function, also named
<span>`time`</span>, that returns the current Greenwich Mean Time in
“the epoch”, which is an arbitrary time used as a reference point. On
UNIX systems, the epoch is 1 January 1970.

    >>> import time
    >>> time.time()
    1437746094.5735958

Write a script that reads the current time and converts it to a time of
day in hours, minutes, and seconds, plus the number of days since the
epoch.

Fermat’s Last Theorem says that there are no positive integers \(a\),
\(b\), and \(c\) such that

\[a^n + b^n = c^n\] for any values of \(n\) greater than 2.

1.  Write a function named `check_fermat` that takes four
    parameters—<span>`a`</span>, <span>`b`</span>, <span>`c`</span>
    and <span>`n`</span>—and checks to see if Fermat’s theorem holds. If
    \(n\) is greater than 2 and
    
    \[a^n + b^n = c^n\] the program should print, “Holy smokes, Fermat
    was wrong\!” Otherwise the program should print, “No, that doesn’t
    work.”

2.  Write a function that prompts the user to input values for
    <span>`a`</span>, <span>`b`</span>, <span>`c`</span> and
    <span>`n`</span>, converts them to integers, and uses `check_fermat`
    to check whether they violate Fermat’s theorem.

If you are given three sticks, you may or may not be able to arrange
them in a triangle. For example, if one of the sticks is 12 inches long
and the other two are one inch long, you will not be able to get the
short sticks to meet in the middle. For any three lengths, there is a
simple test to see if it is possible to form a triangle:

> If any of the three lengths is greater than the sum of the other two,
> then you cannot form a triangle. Otherwise, you can. (If the sum of
> two lengths equals the third, they form what is called a “degenerate”
> triangle.)

1.  Write a function named `is_triangle` that takes three integers as
    arguments, and that prints either “Yes” or “No”, depending on
    whether you can or cannot form a triangle from sticks with the given
    lengths.

2.  Write a function that prompts the user to input three stick lengths,
    converts them to integers, and uses `is_triangle` to check whether
    sticks with the given lengths can form a triangle.

2.  Write a docstring that explains everything someone would need to
    know in order to use this function (and nothing else).

The following exercises use the <span>`turtle`</span> module, described
in Chapter [5](#turtlechap):

Read the following function and see if you can figure out what it does
(see the examples in Chapter [5](#turtlechap)). Then run it and see if
you got it right.

        if n == 0:
            return
        angle = 50
        t.fd(length*n)
        t.lt(angle)
        draw(t, length, n-1)
        t.rt(2*angle)
        draw(t, length, n-1)
        t.lt(angle)
        t.bk(length*n)


![A Koch curve.](figs/koch.pdf.svg)

The Koch curve is a fractal that looks something like
Figure [6.2](#fig.koch). To draw a Koch curve with length \(x\), all
you have to do is

1.  Draw a Koch curve with length \(x/3\).

2.  Turn left 60 degrees.

3.  Draw a Koch curve with length \(x/3\).

4.  Turn right 120 degrees.

5.  Draw a Koch curve with length \(x/3\).

6.  Turn left 60 degrees.

7.  Draw a Koch curve with length \(x/3\).

The exception is if \(x\) is less than 3: in that case, you can just
draw a straight line with length \(x\).

1.  Write a function called <span>`koch`</span> that takes a turtle and
    a length as parameters, and that uses the turtle to draw a Koch
    curve with the given length.

2.  Write a function called <span>`snowflake`</span> that draws three
    Koch curves to make the outline of a snowflake.
    
    Solution: <http://thinkpython2.com/code/koch.py>.

3.  The Koch curve can be generalized in several ways. See
    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake> for examples and
    implement your favorite.
