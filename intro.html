<h2>The strange history of this book<a class="headerlink" href="#the-strange-history-of-this-book" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In January 1999 I was preparing to teach an introductory programming
class in Java. I had taught it three times and I was getting frustrated.
The failure rate in the class was too high and, even for students who
succeeded, the overall level of achievement was too low.</p>
<p>One of the problems I saw was the books. They were too big, with too
much unnecessary detail about Java, and not enough high-level guidance
about how to program. And they all suffered from the trap door effect:
they would start out easy, proceed gradually, and then somewhere around
Chapter 5 the bottom would fall out. The students would get too much new
material, too fast, and I would spend the rest of the semester picking
up the pieces.</p>
<p>Two weeks before the first day of classes, I decided to write my own
book. My goals were:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Keep it short. It is better for students to read 10 pages than not
read 50 pages.</p></li>
<li><p>Be careful with vocabulary. I tried to minimize jargon and define
each term at first use.</p></li>
<li><p>Build gradually. To avoid trap doors, I took the most difficult
topics and split them into a series of small steps.</p></li>
<li><p>Focus on programming, not the programming language. I included the
minimum useful subset of Java and left out the rest.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I needed a title, so on a whim I chose <span><em>How to Think Like a
Computer Scientist</em></span>.</p>
<p>My first version was rough, but it worked. Students did the reading, and
they understood enough that I could spend class time on the hard topics,
the interesting topics and (most important) letting the students
practice.</p>
<p>I released the book under the GNU Free Documentation License, which
allows users to copy, modify, and distribute the book.</p>
<p>What happened next is the cool part. Jeff Elkner, a high school teacher
in Virginia, adopted my book and translated it into Python. He sent me a
copy of his translation, and I had the unusual experience of learning
Python by reading my own book. As Green Tea Press, I published the first
Python version in 2001.</p>
<p>In 2003 I started teaching at Olin College and I got to teach Python for
the first time. The contrast with Java was striking. Students struggled
less, learned more, worked on more interesting projects, and generally
had a lot more fun.</p>
<p>Since then I’ve continued to develop the book, correcting errors,
improving some of the examples and adding material, especially
exercises.</p>
<p>The result is this book, now with the less grandiose title <span><em>Think
Python</em></span>. Some of the changes are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I added a section about debugging at the end of each chapter. These
sections present general techniques for finding and avoiding bugs,
and warnings about Python pitfalls.</p></li>
<li><p>I added more exercises, ranging from short tests of understanding to
a few substantial projects. Most exercises include a link to my
solution.</p></li>
<li><p>I added a series of case studies—longer examples with exercises,
solutions, and discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>I expanded the discussion of program development plans and basic
design patterns.</p></li>
<li><p>I added appendices about debugging and analysis of algorithms.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The second edition of <span><em>Think Python</em></span> has these new
features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The book and all supporting code have been updated to Python 3.</p></li>
<li><p>I added a few sections, and more details on the web, to help
beginners get started running Python in a browser, so you don’t have
to deal with installing Python until you want to.</p></li>
<li><p>For Chapter <a class="reference external" href="#turtle">5.1</a> I switched from my own turtle graphics
package, called Swampy, to a more standard Python module, <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"> <span class="pre">turtle</span></code></span>, which is easier to install and more powerful.</p></li>
<li><p>I added a new chapter called “The Goodies”, which introduces some
additional Python features that are not strictly necessary, but
sometimes handy.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you enjoy working with this book, and that it helps you learn to
program and think like a computer scientist, at least a little bit.</p>

<h2>Contributor List<a class="headerlink" href="#contributor-list" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>More than 100 sharp-eyed and thoughtful readers have sent in suggestions
and corrections over the past few years. Their contributions, and
enthusiasm for this project, have been a huge help.</p>
<p>If you have a suggestion or correction, please send email to
<span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">feedback&#64;thinkpython.com</span></code></span>. If I make a change based on
your feedback, I will add you to the contributor list (unless you ask to
be omitted).</p>
<p>If you include at least part of the sentence the error appears in, that
makes it easy for me to search. Page and section numbers are fine, too,
but not quite as easy to work with. Thanks!</p>
