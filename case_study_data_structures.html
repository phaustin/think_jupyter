<h1>Case study: data structure selection<a class="headerlink" href="#case-study-data-structure-selection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>At this point you have learned about Python’s core data structures, and
you have seen some of the algorithms that use them. If you would like to
know more about algorithms, this might be a good time to read
Chapter <a class="reference external" href="#algorithms">22</a>. But you don’t have to read it before you go
on; you can read it whenever you are interested.</p>
<p>This chapter presents a case study with exercises that let you think
about choosing data structures and practice using them.</p>
<div class="section" id="word-frequency-analysis">
<h2>Word frequency analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#word-frequency-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As usual, you should at least attempt the exercises before you read my
solutions.</p>
<p>Write a program that reads a file, breaks each line into words, strips
whitespace and punctuation from the words, and converts them to
lowercase.</p>
<p>Hint: The <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">string</span></code></span> module provides a string named
<span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">whitespace</span></code></span>, which contains space, tab, newline, etc., and
<span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"> <span class="pre">punctuation</span></code></span> which contains the punctuation characters.
Let’s see if we can make Python swear:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt;&gt;&gt; import string
&gt;&gt;&gt; string.punctuation
&#39;!&quot;#$%&amp;\&#39;()*+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\\]^_`{|}~&#39;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Also, you might consider using the string methods <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">strip</span></code></span>,
<span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">replace</span></code></span> and <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">translate</span></code></span>.</p>
<p>Go to Project Gutenberg (<a class="reference external" href="http://gutenberg.org">http://gutenberg.org</a>) and download your
favorite out-of-copyright book in plain text format.</p>
<p>Modify your program from the previous exercise to read the book you
downloaded, skip over the header information at the beginning of the
file, and process the rest of the words as before.</p>
<p>Then modify the program to count the total number of words in the book,
and the number of times each word is used.</p>
<p>Print the number of different words used in the book. Compare different
books by different authors, written in different eras. Which author uses
the most extensive vocabulary?</p>
<p>Modify the program from the previous exercise to print the 20 most
frequently used words in the book.</p>
<p>Modify the previous program to read a word list (see
Section <a class="reference external" href="#wordlist">10.1</a>) and then print all the words in the book
that are not in the word list. How many of them are typos? How many of
them are common words that <span><em>should</em></span> be in the word list,
and how many of them are really obscure?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="random-numbers">
<h2>Random numbers<a class="headerlink" href="#random-numbers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Given the same inputs, most computer programs generate the same outputs
every time, so they are said to be <span><strong>deterministic</strong></span>.
Determinism is usually a good thing, since we expect the same
calculation to yield the same result. For some applications, though, we
want the computer to be unpredictable. Games are an obvious example, but
there are more.</p>
<p>Making a program truly nondeterministic turns out to be difficult, but
there are ways to make it at least seem nondeterministic. One of them is
to use algorithms that generate <span><strong>pseudorandom</strong></span> numbers.
Pseudorandom numbers are not truly random because they are generated by
a deterministic computation, but just by looking at the numbers it is
all but impossible to distinguish them from random.</p>
<p>The <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">random</span></code></span> module provides functions that generate
pseudorandom numbers (which I will simply call “random” from here on).</p>
<p>The function <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">random</span></code></span> returns a random float between 0.0
and 1.0 (including 0.0 but not 1.0). Each time you call
<span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">random</span></code></span>, you get the next number in a long series. To see
a sample, run this loop:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>import random

for i in range(10):
    x = random.random()
    print(x)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The function <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">randint</span></code></span> takes parameters <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">low</span></code></span>
and <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">high</span></code></span> and returns an integer between
<span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">low</span></code></span> and <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">high</span></code></span> (including both).</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt;&gt;&gt; random.randint(5, 10)
5
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.randint(5, 10)
9
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To choose an element from a sequence at random, you can use
<span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">choice</span></code></span>:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.choice(t)
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; random.choice(t)
3
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">random</span></code></span> module also provides functions to generate
random values from continuous distributions including Gaussian,
exponential, gamma, and a few more.</p>
<p>Write a function named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">choose_from_hist</span></code> that takes a histogram as
defined in Section <a class="reference external" href="#histogram">12.2</a> and returns a random value from
the histogram, chosen with probability in proportion to frequency. For
example, for this histogram:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; hist = histogram(t)
&gt;&gt;&gt; hist
{&#39;a&#39;: 2, &#39;b&#39;: 1}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>your function should return <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'a'</span></code> with probability (2/3) and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'b'</span></code>
with probability (1/3).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="word-histogram">
<h2>Word histogram<a class="headerlink" href="#word-histogram" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You should attempt the previous exercises before you go on. You can
download my solution from
<a class="reference external" href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/analyze_book1.py">http://thinkpython2.com/code/analyze_book1.py</a>. You will also need
<a class="reference external" href="http://thinkpython2.com/code/emma.txt">http://thinkpython2.com/code/emma.txt</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a program that reads a file and builds a histogram of the words
in the file:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>import string

def process_file(filename):
    hist = dict()
    fp = open(filename)
    for line in fp:
        process_line(line, hist)
    return hist

def process_line(line, hist):
    line = line.replace(&#39;-&#39;, &#39; &#39;)
    
    for word in line.split():
        word = word.strip(string.punctuation + string.whitespace)
        word = word.lower()
        hist[word] = hist.get(word, 0) + 1

hist = process_file(&#39;emma.txt&#39;)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This program reads <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">emma.txt</span></code></span>, which contains the text of
<span> <em>Emma</em></span> by Jane Austen.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">process_file</span></code> loops through the lines of the file, passing them one at
a time to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">process_line</span></code>. The histogram <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hist</span></code></span> is being
used as an accumulator.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">process_line</span></code> uses the string method <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">replace</span></code></span> to replace
hyphens with spaces before using <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">split</span></code></span> to break the line
into a list of strings. It traverses the list of words and uses
<span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">strip</span></code></span> and <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lower</span></code></span> to remove punctuation and
convert to lower case. (It is a shorthand to say that strings are
“converted”; remember that strings are immutable, so methods like
<span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">strip</span></code></span> and <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">lower</span></code></span> return new strings.)</p>
<p>Finally, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">process_line</span></code> updates the histogram by creating a new item or
incrementing an existing one.</p>
<p>To count the total number of words in the file, we can add up the
frequencies in the histogram:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>def total_words(hist):
    return sum(hist.values())
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The number of different words is just the number of items in the
dictionary:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>def different_words(hist):
    return len(hist)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here is some code to print the results:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>print(&#39;Total number of words:&#39;, total_words(hist))
print(&#39;Number of different words:&#39;, different_words(hist))
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And the results:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Total number of words: 161080
Number of different words: 7214
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="most-common-words">
<h2>Most common words<a class="headerlink" href="#most-common-words" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To find the most common words, we can make a list of tuples, where each
tuple contains a word and its frequency, and sort it.</p>
<p>The following function takes a histogram and returns a list of
word-frequency tuples:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>def most_common(hist):
    t = []
    for key, value in hist.items():
        t.append((value, key))

    t.sort(reverse=True)
    return t
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In each tuple, the frequency appears first, so the resulting list is
sorted by frequency. Here is a loop that prints the ten most common
words:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>t = most_common(hist)
print(&#39;The most common words are:&#39;)
for freq, word in t[:10]:
    print(word, freq, sep=&#39;\t&#39;)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>I use the keyword argument <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sep</span></code></span> to tell
<span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print</span></code></span> to use a tab character as a “separator”, rather
than a space, so the second column is lined up. Here are the results
from <span><em>Emma</em></span>:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The most common words are:
to      5242
the     5205
and     4897
of      4295
i       3191
a       3130
it      2529
her     2483
was     2400
she     2364
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This code can be simplified using the <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">key</span></code></span> parameter of
the <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sort</span></code></span> function. If you are curious, you can read about
it at <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/HowTo/Sorting">https://wiki.python.org/moin/HowTo/Sorting</a>.</p>

optional arguments, too. For example, here is a function that prints the
most common words in a histogram</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>def print_most_common(hist, num=10):
    t = most_common(hist)
    print(&#39;The most common words are:&#39;)
    for freq, word in t[:num]:
        print(word, freq, sep=&#39;\t&#39;)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The first parameter is required; the second is optional. The
<span><strong>default value</strong></span> of <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">num</span></code></span> is 10.</p>
<p>If you only provide one argument:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>print_most_common(hist)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">num</span></code></span> gets the default value. If you provide two arguments:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>print_most_common(hist, 20)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">num</span></code></span> gets the value of the argument instead. In other
words, the optional argument <span><strong>overrides</strong></span> the default
value.</p>
<p>If a function has both required and optional parameters, all the
required parameters have to come first, followed by the optional ones.</p>

<h2>Random words<a class="headerlink" href="#random-words" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To choose a random word from the histogram, the simplest algorithm is to
build a list with multiple copies of each word, according to the
observed frequency, and then choose from the list:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>def random_word(h):
    t = []
    for word, freq in h.items():
        t.extend([word] * freq)

    return random.choice(t)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The expression <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[word]</span> <span class="pre">*</span> <span class="pre">freq</span></code></span> creates a list with
<span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">freq</span></code></span> copies of the string <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">word</span></code></span>. The
<span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">extend</span></code></span> method is similar to <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">append</span></code></span> except
that the argument is a sequence.</p>
<p>This algorithm works, but it is not very efficient; each time you choose
a random word, it rebuilds the list, which is as big as the original
book. An obvious improvement is to build the list once and then make
multiple selections, but the list is still big.</p>
<p>An alternative is:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Use <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">keys</span></code></span> to get a list of the words in the book.</p></li>
<li><p>Build a list that contains the cumulative sum of the word
frequencies (see Exercise <a class="reference external" href="#cumulative">[cumulative]</a>). The last
item in this list is the total number of words in the book, (n).</p></li>
<li><p>Choose a random number from 1 to (n). Use a bisection search (See
Exercise <a class="reference external" href="#bisection">[bisection]</a>) to find the index where the

<h2>Markov analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#markov-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you choose words from the book at random, you can get a sense of the
vocabulary, but you probably won’t get a sentence:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>this the small regard harriet which knightley&#39;s it most things
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A series of random words seldom makes sense because there is no
relationship between successive words. For example, in a real sentence
you would expect an article like “the” to be followed by an adjective or
a noun, and probably not a verb or adverb.</p>
<p>One way to measure these kinds of relationships is Markov analysis,
which characterizes, for a given sequence of words, the probability of
the words that might come next. For example, the song <span><em>Eric, the
Half a Bee</em></span> begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Half a bee, philosophically,<br />
Must, ipso facto, half not be.<br />
But half the bee has got to be<br />
Vis a vis, its entity. D’you see?</p>
<p>But can a bee be said to be<br />
Or not to be an entire bee<br />
When half the bee is not a bee<br />
Due to some ancient injury?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In this text, the phrase “half the” is always followed by the word
“bee”, but the phrase “the bee” might be followed by either “has” or
“is”.</p>
<p>The result of Markov analysis is a mapping from each prefix (like “half
the” and “the bee”) to all possible suffixes (like “has” and “is”).</p>
<p>Given this mapping, you can generate a random text by starting with any
prefix and choosing at random from the possible suffixes. Next, you can
combine the end of the prefix and the new suffix to form the next
prefix, and repeat.</p>
<p>For example, if you start with the prefix “Half a”, then the next word
has to be “bee”, because the prefix only appears once in the text. The
next prefix is “a bee”, so the next suffix might be “philosophically”,
“be” or “due”.</p>
<p>In this example the length of the prefix is always two, but you can do
Markov analysis with any prefix length.</p>
<p>Markov analysis:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Write a program to read a text from a file and perform Markov
analysis. The result should be a dictionary that maps from prefixes
to a collection of possible suffixes. The collection might be a
list, tuple, or dictionary; it is up to you to make an appropriate
choice. You can test your program with prefix length two, but you
should write the program in a way that makes it easy to try other
lengths.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a function to the previous program to generate random text based
on the Markov analysis. Here is an example from <span><em>Emma</em></span>
with prefix length 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>He was very clever, be it sweetness or be angry, ashamed or only
amused, at such a stroke. She had never thought of Hannah till you
were never meant for me?” “I cannot make speeches, Emma:” he soon
cut it all himself.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>For this example, I left the punctuation attached to the words. The
result is almost syntactically correct, but not quite. Semantically,
it almost makes sense, but not quite.</p>
<p>What happens if you increase the prefix length? Does the random text
make more sense?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once your program is working, you might want to try a mash-up: if
you combine text from two or more books, the random text you
generate will blend the vocabulary and phrases from the sources in
interesting ways.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="data-structures">
<h2>Data structures<a class="headerlink" href="#data-structures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Using Markov analysis to generate random text is fun, but there is also
a point to this exercise: data structure selection. In your solution to
the previous exercises, you had to choose:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>How to represent the prefixes.</p></li>
<li><p>How to represent the collection of possible suffixes.</p></li>
<li><p>How to represent the mapping from each prefix to the collection of
possible suffixes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The last one is easy: a dictionary is the obvious choice for a mapping
from keys to corresponding values.</p>
<p>For the prefixes, the most obvious options are string, list of strings,
or tuple of strings.</p>
<p>For the suffixes, one option is a list; another is a histogram
(dictionary).</p>
<p>How should you choose? The first step is to think about the operations
you will need to implement for each data structure. For the prefixes, we
need to be able to remove words from the beginning and add to the end.
For example, if the current prefix is “Half a”, and the next word is
“bee”, you need to be able to form the next prefix, “a bee”.</p>
<p>Your first choice might be a list, since it is easy to add and remove
elements, but we also need to be able to use the prefixes as keys in a
dictionary, so that rules out lists. With tuples, you can’t append or
remove, but you can use the addition operator to form a new tuple:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>def shift(prefix, word):
    return prefix[1:] + (word,)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">shift</span></code></span> takes a tuple of words, <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">prefix</span></code></span>, and
a string, <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">word</span></code></span>, and forms a new tuple that has all the
words in <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">prefix</span></code></span> except the first, and <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">word</span></code></span>
added to the end.</p>
<p>For the collection of suffixes, the operations we need to perform
include adding a new suffix (or increasing the frequency of an existing
one), and choosing a random suffix.</p>
<p>Adding a new suffix is equally easy for the list implementation or the
histogram. Choosing a random element from a list is easy; choosing from
a histogram is harder to do efficiently (see
Exercise <a class="reference external" href="#randhist">[randhist]</a>).</p>
<p>So far we have been talking mostly about ease of implementation, but
there are other factors to consider in choosing data structures. One is
run time. Sometimes there is a theoretical reason to expect one data
structure to be faster than other; for example, I mentioned that the
<span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">in</span></code></span> operator is faster for dictionaries than for lists, at
least when the number of elements is large.</p>
<p>But often you don’t know ahead of time which implementation will be
faster. One option is to implement both of them and see which is better.
This approach is called <span><strong>benchmarking</strong></span>. A practical
alternative is to choose the data structure that is easiest to
implement, and then see if it is fast enough for the intended
application. If so, there is no need to go on. If not, there are tools,
like the <span><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">profile</span></code></span> module, that can identify the places in
a program that take the most time.</p>
<p>The other factor to consider is storage space. For example, using a
histogram for the collection of suffixes might take less space because
you only have to store each word once, no matter how many times it
appears in the text. In some cases, saving space can also make your
program run faster, and in the extreme, your program might not run at
all if you run out of memory. But for many applications, space is a
secondary consideration after run time.</p>
<p>One final thought: in this discussion, I have implied that we should use
one data structure for both analysis and generation. But since these are
separate phases, it would also be possible to use one structure for
analysis and then convert to another structure for generation. This
would be a net win if the time saved during generation exceeded the time
spent in conversion.</p>

<h2>Debugging<a class="headerlink" href="#debugging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When you are debugging a program, and especially if you are working on a
hard bug, there are five things to try:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Reading:<br />
Examine your code, read it back to yourself, and check that it says
what you meant to say.</p></li>
<li><p>Running:<br />
Experiment by making changes and running different versions. Often
if you display the right thing at the right place in the program,
the problem becomes obvious, but sometimes you have to build
scaffolding.</p></li>
<li><p>Ruminating:<br />
Take some time to think! What kind of error is it: syntax, runtime,
or semantic? What information can you get from the error messages,
or from the output of the program? What kind of error could cause
the problem you’re seeing? What did you change last, before the
problem appeared?</p></li>
<li><p>Rubberducking:<br />
If you explain the problem to someone else, you sometimes find the
answer before you finish asking the question. Often you don’t need
the other person; you could just talk to a rubber duck. And that’s
the origin of the well-known strategy called <span> <strong>rubber duck
debugging</strong></span>. I am not making this up; see
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Retreating:<br />
At some point, the best thing to do is back off, undoing recent
changes, until you get back to a program that works and that you
understand. Then you can start rebuilding.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Beginning programmers sometimes get stuck on one of these activities and
forget the others. Each activity comes with its own failure mode.</p>
<p>For example, reading your code might help if the problem is a
typographical error, but not if the problem is a conceptual
misunderstanding. If you don’t understand what your program does, you
can read it 100 times and never see the error, because the error is in
your head.</p>
<p>Running experiments can help, especially if you run small, simple tests.
But if you run experiments without thinking or reading your code, you
might fall into a pattern I call “random walk programming”, which is the
process of making random changes until the program does the right thing.
Needless to say, random walk programming can take a long time.</p>
<p>You have to take time to think. Debugging is like an experimental
science. You should have at least one hypothesis about what the problem
is. If there are two or more possibilities, try to think of a test that
would eliminate one of them.</p>
<p>But even the best debugging techniques will fail if there are too many
errors, or if the code you are trying to fix is too big and complicated.
Sometimes the best option is to retreat, simplifying the program until
you get to something that works and that you understand.</p>
<p>Beginning programmers are often reluctant to retreat because they can’t
stand to delete a line of code (even if it’s wrong). If it makes you
feel better, copy your program into another file before you start
stripping it down. Then you can copy the pieces back one at a time.</p>
<p>Finding a hard bug requires reading, running, ruminating, and sometimes
retreating. If you get stuck on one of these activities, try the others.</p>

<p>The “rank” of a word is its position in a list of words sorted by
frequency: the most common word has rank 1, the second most common has
rank 2, etc.</p>
<p>Zipf’s law describes a relationship between the ranks and frequencies of
words in natural languages (<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law</a>).
Specifically, it predicts that the frequency, (f), of the word with
rank (r) is:</p>
<p>[f = c r^{-s}] where (s) and (c) are parameters that depend on the
language and the text. If you take the logarithm of both sides of this
equation, you get:</p>
<p>[\log f = \log c - s \log r] So if you plot log (f) versus log
(r), you should get a straight line with slope (-s) and intercept
log (c).</p>
<p>Write a program that reads a text from a file, counts word frequencies,
and prints one line for each word, in descending order of frequency,
with log (f) and log (r). Use the graphing program of your choice to
plot the results and check whether they form a straight line. Can you
estimate the value of (s)?</p>
